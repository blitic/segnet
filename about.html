        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor2">Our Philosophy:</h3>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, global pattern are changing very fast. The way things are being done is a sharp contrast from the
          past. Technology and technological process now control the way businesses and general activities deliver their outputs
          to the global citizens. The internet of things and the era of smart phone penetration now define the interaction level
          between people, society and government. Strictly speaking in modern times it is a requirement for any person willing to
          engage with persons or institution for any service delivery.
          Locally, development model take different shapes. In Kenya social investment grouping commonly referred to as charms is
          the most popular investment for the ordinary persons. The women talk of Kenya are tamed for their serious contribution
          in the economy through chamas, financial institution and even government now appreciate the women talk contribution to
          GDP. Through mobilization of resources and the Chama concept. The reason why there is now a clear policy to support
          enterprise based towards women, the youth and the disabled. Their contribution to the national economy cannot be
          overstated. Chama play a critical role in enterprise development
          It is against their background that usorg affiliates Kenya (Nairobi) was founded as a social enterprise that seeks the
          to provide a platform through the digital space where upon Chama can take the position of affiliates to share their
          activities with likeminded organization and partners in an interactive system in the digital space. The challenge
          currently therefore is for usorg to reach out to various groups in the region and impress upon them to affiliate their
          activities in the digital platform so as to improve their performance and make a bigger impact in their contribution to
          the economy.
          Besides providing the platform, usorg seeks to be management partner of choice for Chamaâ€™s and commonly based
          organization through providing capacity building services. This is born from the fact that management challenges are
          obviously a glazing reality across most of the social investment groupings. Our training model based on the patners and
          associates many years of research and experience shall be accessible in our digital space. Usorg is currently
          undertaking the development of website through our expert and associate.
